# SG Public Property Scanner (2022)

I created a property price viewer based on the Singapore public housing that is publicly available on data.gov.sg. 
I am hoping that providing this data in a more in intuitively way, more people are able to access it, and hence be able to make more 
sensible decisions with regards to their housing transactions.
