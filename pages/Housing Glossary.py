#### Housing Glossary

Thanks my friend, Dean for suggesting I add a glossary to the different housing types. However, given the available resources online, I think it makes more sense for me to just share the links we found. If anyone researches hard enough online, he or she will most probably find the same links as me. I do not earn from any of these links. 

I cannot confirm the availability of these links as well, so if any of them are done, do inform me!

I do understand he sell services on acquiring data. His explanations on different HDB flat and model types does look quite extensive.
